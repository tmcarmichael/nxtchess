# NXT Chess

## Backend - Golang REST, PostgreSQL

\*_in progress_

### Design

- Core application + domain logic, orchestrating Stockfish, websockets, DB reads/writes.
- Separate domain logic (services), data access (repositories), and HTTP/websocket logic (controllers).
- Using [Chi Router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi).

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

**[Prerequisite: Install Golang]**(https://go.dev/doc/install)

Depending on your IDE, it's recommended to open the backend up at /apps/backend instead of the repo root.

When MOCK_DB is set true in /env, mock DB connection is used.
