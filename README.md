## üöÄ Project Vision

Create a lean, high-performance, multiplayer chess platform that incorporates unique training modes and AI-driven features.

**_The project is currently in early development, with a focus on building the frontend client and core game logic. Check out the Roadmap below for more details on our plans and progress._**

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/), and a styling solution (TBD: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), or [Macaron](https://macaron.js.org/docs/styling/)).

- **Backend:**
  [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) Golang Router, Websockets, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), with containerization using Docker/Compose.

- **Infrastructure & Tooling:**
  Logging, monitoring, and other support systems (e.g., ELK/Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).

## üìú Roadmap

What's planned?

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay ‚úÖ

- [x] Chessboard rendering.
- [x] Responsive design.
- [x] Implement full chess rules (move validation, checkmate detection, etc.).
- [x] Add drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive piece movement.
- [x] Highlight squares for legal moves when clicking pieces.
- [x] Checkmate, game end, and game restart logic.
- [x] Game Panel initial implementation.
- [x] Implement basic AI (easy/medium/hard).
- [x] Game Panel functional for AI play with time controls (3min, 5min, 10min).
- [x] Game clock & board flip functionality.

### Phase 2: Polished Core Gameplay and Non-Gameplay Essentials

- [x] Navigation panel and game move history.
- [x] Implement "take back last move" functionality.
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for web app interaction.
- [x] Refactor frontend from rapid development, clear UI layer, Service layer, State management.
- [x] Containerize frontend for development (Docker builds for local and later server integration).
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Adopt a styling library (Tailwind, PostCSS, or Macaron).
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Enhance board resizing, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Enable full offline AI mode via service worker after initial bundle download.

### Phase 3: OAuth sign in on frontend and persisting profile and game data

- [x] Develop a Golang server integrated with PostgreSQL DB.
- [x] Create tables and validate with mock DB.
- [ ] Handle sign in, profile GET/POST.
- [ ] Create tables for game data linked to profiles.
- [ ] Hook frontend 'sign in' to backend and validate tables update.
- [ ] Finalize user OAuth sign in and test.
- [ ] Create profile page on frontend with basic dashboard and info.
- [ ] End-to-End validation of user sign in and initial server calls.

### Phase 4: Server extended for human multiplayer and server engine use

- [ ] Wrap Stockfish binary with Golang, interfacing via UCI for engine evaluation.
- [ ] Containerize the backend for local testing alongside the frontend.
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose to orchestrate FE and BE builds for rapid local development.
- [ ] Refactor to enable either frontend WASM stockfish engine or server-side engine calculations.
- [ ] Implement testing strategy for frontend and backend.
- [ ] Push containers to a registry for deployment.

### Phase 5: Deployment, Logging, and Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend containers to staging and production environments.
- [ ] Integrate centralized logging (ELK/Fluentd) for real-time error tracking.
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) for system performance.
- [ ] Implement health checks and auto-scaling policies for robust deployments.

### Phase 6: Database and User Account Setup

- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL for persistent storage of game data, user profiles, and history.
- [ ] Implement secure user authentication and authorization (JWT/OAuth2).
- [ ] Develop REST API endpoints for user management and game history retrieval.
- [ ] Enable real-time analytics and player statistics tracking.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Introduce lightweight GraphQL endpoints for efficient client queries.

### Phase 7: Advanced Features

- [ ] Develop unique AI chess game modes, training tools, and interactive tutorials.
- [ ] Build a tournament system.
- [ ] Enhance player profiles with detailed statistics.
- [ ] Integrate anti-cheat mechanisms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Frontend:

- **Node.js** (>v16)
- **yarn**

Backend:

- **Golang**

### Frontend

#### Local Frontend:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmcarmichael/nxtchess.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nxtchess
```

3. Navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to the localhost port suggested by Vite, such as, http://localhost:5173/

#### Local Docker Frontend:

1. Download Docker desktop for Docker and Docker Compose. Or ensure you have both installed. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.

2. Navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
```

3. Build local container:

```bash
yarn docker:dev:build
```

3. Spin up local container:

```bash
yarn docker:dev:run
```

4. Access container at localhost, http://localhost/

5. Alternatively, use Docker Desktop and look for image 'nxtchess-frontend-dev', click "open in browser".
