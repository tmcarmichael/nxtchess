## üöÄ Vision

The goal is to create a high-performance multiplayer chess platform that incorporates unique training modes and AI-driven features. Key objectives include:

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Delivering seamless, responsive gameplay.
- **Personalized User Experience**: Supporting accounts with game histories and performance tracking.
- **Comprehensive Game Database**: Enabling players to study and analyze past games.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Providing game reviews and training modes to help players improve their skills.

**_The project is currently in early development, with a focus on building the frontend client and core game logic. Check out the Roadmap below for more details on our plans and progress._**

## üíª Tech Stack

### Frontend: **SolidJS**

The frontend is built with **SolidJS**, a modern JavaScript library known for its **fine-grained reactivity** and **high performance**. Why was **SolidJS** chosen?

1. **Fine-Grained Reactivity**:

   - Unlike traditional virtual DOM-based libraries (e.g., React), SolidJS updates the DOM precisely where changes occur.
   - This granular approach minimizes unnecessary renders and improves performance, especially for highly interactive interfaces like a chessboard.

2. **Minimal Overhead**:

   - SolidJS compiles components into lightweight, efficient JavaScript code. There's no runtime virtual DOM diffing, which makes the app faster and more memory-efficient.

3. **Scalability**:

   - The reactive core of SolidJS allows the app to scale seamlessly without introducing complexity. This will be critical as we implement multiplayer features, live spectating, and analysis tools.

### Styling

- **CSS Modules** are used for scoped, maintainable styling, ensuring that each component has its own isolated styles.
- The chessboard design is minimalistic, with clean visuals optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.
