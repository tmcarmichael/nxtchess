## üöÄ Project Vision

Create a lean, high-performance, multiplayer chess platform that incorporates unique training modes and AI-driven features.

**_The project is currently in early development. Check out the Roadmap below for more details on our plans and progress._**

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/), and a styling solution (TBD: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), or [Macaron](https://macaron.js.org/docs/styling/)).

- **Backend:**
  [Golang](https://go.dev/), [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) Golang Router, Websockets, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), with containerization using Docker/Compose.

- **Infrastructure & Tooling:**
  Logging, monitoring, and other support systems (e.g., ELK/Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).

## üìú Roadmap

What's planned next?

### üöÄ (In Progress) Phase 4: Server Engine Integration, Rating, and Training

- [ ] Wrap the Stockfish binary in Golang to interface via UCI for server-side engine evaluations.
- [ ] Implement server-side move validation, rating calculations, and storage of game results.
- [ ] Reflect multiple rating types (blitz, rapid, AI training) in user profiles.
- [ ] Add websocket support for real-time rated modes against engine or human players.
- [ ] Refactor the frontend chessboard for seamless reuse across various game modes.
- [ ] Refine user flows for account creation, username collisions, and sign-in edge cases.

### Phase 5: Deployment, Logging, and Monitoring

- [ ] Deploy FE & BE on Azure Apps, sidecar Redis instance for ephemeral session data.
- [ ] Deploy a basic/free tier PostgresDB for persisting profiles and game history.
- [ ] Establish a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- [ ] Create staging and prod realms and integrate with CI/CD.
- [ ] Implement a minimal ELK stack to centralize, index, and visualize logs.
- [ ] Prometheus for metrics from Golang server, Postgres, and Redis sidecar.
- [ ] Grafana to visualize key Prometheus logs, health checks, and alerting.
- [ ] Configure domain, SSL certificates, and AKS env-based secret management for prod.

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance and Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical frontend and backend flows.
- [ ] Enable coverage reports and automated testing in CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] Load testing and optimization of server concurrency/caching strategies.
- [ ] Database indexing, migrations, and query performance.
- [ ] Integrate security scanning and code linting checks into CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Expand i18n/l10n support or plan for multi-language interfaces.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Improve board resizing, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

### Phase 7: Enhanced Mechanics and Community

- [ ] Develop unique AI training modes with server-based analysis.
- [ ] Build a tournament system with scheduling, brackets, and user match histories.
- [ ] Introduce friend lists or user-specific invites for community matches.
- [ ] Add advanced player profile statistics and anti-cheat mechanisms.
- [ ] Create a basic community layer (forums, Discord integration).
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ API contract (OpenAPI, gRPC, or GraphQL) to formalize FE/BE interactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Frontend:

- **Node.js** (>v16)
- **yarn**

Backend:

- **Golang**

### Frontend

#### Local Frontend:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmcarmichael/nxtchess.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nxtchess
```

3. Navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

6. Open your browser and navigate to the localhost port suggested by Vite, such as, http://localhost:5173/

#### Local Docker Frontend:

1. Download Docker desktop for Docker and Docker Compose. Or ensure you have both installed. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.

2. Navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
```

3. Build local container:

```bash
yarn docker:dev:build
```

3. Spin up local container:

```bash
yarn docker:dev:run
```

4. Access container at localhost, http://localhost/

5. Alternatively, use Docker Desktop and look for image 'nxtchess-frontend-dev', click "open in browser".
