## üöÄ Project Vision

Create a lean, high-performance, multiplayer chess platform that incorporates unique training modes and AI-driven features.

**_The project is currently in early development, with a focus on building the frontend client and core game logic. Check out the Roadmap below for more details on our plans and progress._**

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/), and a styling solution (TBD: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), or [Macaron](https://macaron.js.org/docs/styling/)).

- **Backend:**
  [Golang](https://go.dev/), REST, Websockets, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), with containerization using Docker/Compose.

- **Infrastructure & Tooling:**
  Logging, monitoring, and other support systems (e.g., ELK/Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).

## üìú Roadmap

What‚Äôs planned?

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay ‚úÖ

- [x] Chessboard rendering.
- [x] Responsive design.
- [x] Implement full chess rules (move validation, checkmate detection, etc.).
- [x] Add drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive piece movement.
- [x] Highlight squares for legal moves when clicking pieces.
- [x] Checkmate, game end, and game restart logic.
- [x] Game Panel initial implementation.
- [x] Implement basic AI (easy/medium/hard).
- [x] Game Panel functional for AI play with time controls (3min, 5min, 10min).
- [x] Game clock & board flip functionality.

### Phase 2: Polished Core Gameplay and Non-Gameplay Essentials

- [ ] Containerize frontend for development (Docker builds for local and later server integration).
- [ ] Navigation panel and game move history.
- [ ] Implement "take back last move" functionality.
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for web app interaction.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Adopt a styling library (Tailwind, PostCSS, or Macaron).
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Enhance board resizing, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Enable full offline AI mode via service worker after initial bundle download.

### Phase 3: Server for Move Validation and Multiplayer

- [ ] Develop a Golang REST server to handle game start and related endpoints.
- [ ] Wrap Stockfish binary with Golang, interfacing via UCI for engine evaluation.
- [ ] Containerize the backend for local testing alongside the frontend.
- [ ] Configure Docker Compose to orchestrate FE and BE builds for rapid local development.
- [ ] Remove/refactor frontend AI move logic in favor of server-side evaluation (except for offline mode).
- [ ] Implement full end-to-end tests covering both frontend and backend.
- [ ] Push containers to a registry for deployment.

### Phase 4: Deployment, Logging, and Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Establish a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend containers to staging and production environments.
- [ ] Integrate centralized logging (ELK/Fluentd) for real-time error tracking.
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) for system performance.
- [ ] Implement health checks and auto-scaling policies for robust deployments.

### Phase 5: Database and User Account Setup

- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL for persistent storage of game data, user profiles, and history.
- [ ] Implement secure user authentication and authorization (JWT/OAuth2).
- [ ] Develop REST API endpoints for user management and game history retrieval.
- [ ] Enable real-time analytics and player statistics tracking.
- [ ] _(Nice to have)_ Introduce lightweight GraphQL endpoints for efficient client queries.

### Phase 6: Advanced Features

- [ ] Develop unique AI chess game modes, training tools, and interactive tutorials.
- [ ] Build a tournament system.
- [ ] Enhance player profiles with detailed statistics.
- [ ] Integrate anti-cheat mechanisms.
