# Next Generation Chess 'nxtchess' (Inspiration from Lichess.org)

12/30/24:
The initial steps of building a **high-performance multiplayer chess platform**. This project is inspired by **Lichess.org**, aiming to provide a **free-to-play**, **ad-free** chess experience. The platform will focus on delivering exceptional performance, intuitive gameplay, and scalability for real-time multiplayer interactions.

## üöÄ Vision

The long-term goal is to create a **community-driven chess platform** that prioritizes:

- **Accessibility**: Free for everyone, forever.
- **Performance**: A seamless experience, even on low-end devices.
- **Transparency**: Open-source with no ads or paywalls.
- **Fair Play**: Incorporating anti-cheat mechanisms to ensure a fair environment for players of all skill levels.

This project is currently in its **early stages**, focusing on the frontend. Future iterations will include multiplayer capabilities, accounts, database of games, game analysis tools, and experimental AI integrations.

## üíª Tech Stack

### Frontend: **SolidJS**

The frontend is built with **SolidJS**, a modern JavaScript library known for its **fine-grained reactivity** and **high performance**. Why was **SolidJS** chosen?

1. **Fine-Grained Reactivity**:

   - Unlike traditional virtual DOM-based libraries (e.g., React), SolidJS updates the DOM precisely where changes occur.
   - This granular approach minimizes unnecessary renders and improves performance, especially for highly interactive interfaces like a chessboard.

2. **Minimal Overhead**:

   - SolidJS compiles components into lightweight, efficient JavaScript code. There's no runtime virtual DOM diffing, which makes the app faster and more memory-efficient.

3. **Scalability**:

   - The reactive core of SolidJS allows the app to scale seamlessly without introducing complexity. This will be critical as we implement multiplayer features, live spectating, and analysis tools.

### Styling

- **CSS Modules** are used for scoped, maintainable styling, ensuring that each component has its own isolated styles.
- The chessboard design is minimalistic, with clean visuals optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.
